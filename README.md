# Library-Management-System

This is a Spring Boot application designed to manage information for two entities: **Books** and **Authors**. The application implements basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update) operations, allowing users to manage and view details about books and their authors.

## Features

- **Create**: Add new books and authors through user-friendly forms.
- **Read**: Display lists of all books and authors with the option to view detailed information.
- **Update**: Modify existing book and author details.
- **Database Initialization**: Automatically populates the database with sample data upon startup.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles exceptions and integrity violations.
